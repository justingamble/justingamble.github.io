## Why make a blog?

This blog is meant to help me explore Elixir features, and hopefully be
useful for others as well.  If you have feedback, please send me a note.

## Why Elixir?  

First, it is fun.  Second, it is robust.  Third, I appreciate the leadership
of [Jose Valim](http://github.com/josevalim).  Finally, I am impressed with the Elixir community.

## How did you discover Elixir?

On a landmark night I wandered over to YouTube and watched [GOTO 2014 • Idioms for Building Distributed Fault-tolerant Applications with Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4rOG9Bc65Q) by José Valim.
Fascinated and intrigued I decided to read Dave Thomas's
[Programming Elixir 1.3](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-1-3-Functional-Concurrent/dp/168050200X/) book (there is now a newer version available).  Halfway through the book I knew I was hooked.  Things spiraled from there.  I read through all the available
books at the time, and started reading select blogs on the [Elixir Radar](http://plataformatec.com.br/elixir-radar/weekly-newsletter) newsletter.
Now I am intrigued by all things Elixir.

## What did you use before Elixir?

Before discovering Elixir I used C, C++, Smalltalk, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  I still enjoy these languages.

## What else do you like to do for fun?

I enjoy bicycling, playing chess, and [Star Wars Battlefront](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront).
