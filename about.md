## About Justin

Hi, my name is Justin.  I'm a software developer based in Edmonton, Canada. I enjoy reading, writing,
and collaborating on code.

## Why make a blog?

This blog is meant to help me explore Elixir features, and hopefully help others explore Elixir as well.
If you have feedback, please message me.

## Why Elixir?  

1. Elixir is built on BEAM.  For why that is important, check out the youtube video [The Soul of Erlang and Elixir, by Saša Jurić](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE).
2. Elixir is fun; it implements modern ideas in a fresh way.  
3. Pattern matching and de-structuring is easy to get used to, and hard to live without once you are used to it.
4. Elixir is a stable, robust language.
5. I appreciate the leadership of [José Valim](http://github.com/josevalim){:target="_blank"} and the Elixir community.  Ecto and Phoenix are brilliantly designed.  mix and hex.pm 
are great tools.  The 3rd party packages that I have needed are available and stable.
6. I love that the language is small and consistent.  There are not a ton of syntax
details to remember.  
7. Excellent reference documentation, and excellent book authors as well.

## How did you discover Elixir?

On a landmark night I wandered over to YouTube and watched [GOTO 2014 • Idioms for Building Distributed Fault-tolerant Applications with Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4rOG9Bc65Q){:target="_blank"} by José Valim.
Fascinated and intrigued I picked up and read Dave Thomas's
[Programming Elixir](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-1-6-Functional-Concurrent/dp/1680502999/){:target="_blank"} book.  Halfway through the book I knew I was hooked.  Things spiraled from there.  I read through all the available Elixir books at the time, and started reading blogs on the [Elixir Radar](http://plataformatec.com.br/elixir-radar/weekly-newsletter){:target="_blank"} newsletter.  Now I am implementing projects for myself, and am intrigued by all things Elixir.

## What did you use before Elixir?

Before discovering Elixir I used C, C++, Smalltalk, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  I still enjoy these languages.

## What else do you like to do for fun?

I enjoy working out, bicycling, swimming, reading, playing chess, and dying alot in [Star Wars Battlefront](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront){:target="_blank"}.
