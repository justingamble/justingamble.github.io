## About Justin

Hi, my name is Justin.  I'm a software developer based in Edmonton, Canada. I enjoy reading, writing,
and collaborating on code.

## Why make a blog?

This blog is meant to help me explore Elixir features, and hopefully help others explore Elixir as well.
If you have feedback, please message me.

## Why Elixir?  

1. Elixir is built on BEAM.  For why that is important, check out the youtube video [The Soul of Erlang and Elixir, by Saša Jurić](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE).
2. Elixir is fun; it implements modern ideas in a fresh way.  
3. Elixir is a stable, robust language.
4. I appreciate the leadership of [José Valim](http://github.com/josevalim){:target="_blank"} and the Elixir community.  [Ecto](https://www.amazon.ca/Programming-Ecto-Database-Scalability-Performance/dp/1680502824/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ecto+book&qid=1582015230&s=books&sr=1-3) and [Phoenix](https://www.amazon.ca/Phoenix-Action-Geoffrey-Lessel/dp/1617295043/ref=pd_sbs_14_2/136-3491359-4597008?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1617295043&pd_rd_r=6b9775db-c084-42e9-8d5f-30659e7086b7&pd_rd_w=zymIB&pd_rd_wg=N4PZC&pf_rd_p=74b54c94-7195-4620-ba51-7d167ac58a58&pf_rd_r=A8NCQEYHW6XDCDR2TCVN&psc=1&refRID=A8NCQEYHW6XDCDR2TCVN) are brilliantly designed.  mix and hex.pm
are examples of great tooling.  Broadway and [Absinthe](https://www.amazon.ca/Craft-GraphQL-APIs-Elixir-Absinthe/dp/1680502557/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Absinthe+elixir&qid=1582015306&s=books&sr=1-2) are cutting edge.
5. Excellent reference documentation, and excellent book authors as well.

## How did you discover Elixir?

On a landmark night I wandered over to YouTube and watched [GOTO 2014 • Idioms for Building Distributed Fault-tolerant Applications with Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4rOG9Bc65Q){:target="_blank"} by José Valim.
Fascinated and intrigued I picked up and read Dave Thomas's
[Programming Elixir](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-1-6-Functional-Concurrent/dp/1680502999/){:target="_blank"} book.  Halfway through the book I knew I was hooked.  Things spiraled from there.  I read through all the available Elixir books at the time, and started reading blogs on the [Elixir Radar](http://plataformatec.com.br/elixir-radar/weekly-newsletter){:target="_blank"} newsletter.  Now I am implementing projects for myself, and am intrigued by all things Elixir.

## What did you use before Elixir?

Before discovering Elixir I used C, C++, Smalltalk, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  I still enjoy these languages.

## What else do you like to do for fun?

I enjoy working out, bicycling, swimming, reading, playing chess, and dying alot in [Star Wars Battlefront](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront){:target="_blank"}.
