One night I wandered over to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) and watched this presentation by Jose Valim.
Fascinated and intrigued I next read through Dave Thomas's
[Programming Elixir](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-1-6-Functional-Concurrent/dp/1680502999/) book.  Things spiraled from there.  Now I am intrigued by all things Elixir.

Why Elixir?  First, it is fun.  Second, it is robust.  Third, I appreciate the leadership
of [Jose Valim](http://github.com/josevalim).  Finally, I am impressed with the Elixir community.

This blog is meant to help me explore language features and constructs, and hopefully be
useful for others as well.  If you have feedback for me, please send me a note.
