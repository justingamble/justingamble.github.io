## Session 2: Pattern Matching

### Context

I am presenting Elixir to the software developers at my company during lunch hours.
This is the material from session 2.  For session 1, please refer to [this post]({% post_url 2019-05-19-study-session-1 %}).

### Presentation Material

For the presentation material, I collected and presented a number of examples from the
relevant pattern matching chapters of
* ["Learn Functional Programming with Elixir"](https://www.amazon.ca/Learn-Functional-Programming-Elixir-Foundations/dp/168050245X/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=learn+functional+programming+with+elixir&qid=1558307840&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmrnull), and
* ["Elixir In Action (2nd ed)"](https://www.amazon.ca/Elixir-Action-Sa%C5%A1a-Juri-cacute/dp/1617295027/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=elixir+in+action&qid=1558322196&s=gateway&sr=8-1)

### Exercise: Employee Info

I reviewed a number of online exercises, but I found them to be too simple.  I wanted a realistic program with extensive use of pattern matching.  I decided to create my own.

The exercise program stores employee records.  The program is longer than I initially
intended, but it offers several examples of pattern matching.  The exercise is [available here](https://bitbucket.org/siberianTiger/elixir-sessions/src/master/exercises/employee-info/).  See the README for more details.

## Next session

The next session will focus on Recursion.
